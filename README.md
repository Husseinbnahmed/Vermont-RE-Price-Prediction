# Predicting home prices in West Dover Vermont to shop for Airbnb properties
We're excited to dive into the real estate market in West Dover, VT and uncover some valuable insights! Here's a summary of our findings so far:

## Positive Relationship Between Time of Sale and Price per Square Foot üìà
It looks like there's a strong positive correlation between the time a property was sold and its price per square foot. In fact, the median price per square foot saw a significant increase of 23% from 2020 to 2022. Additionally, when comparing the 75th percentile, we see that in 2022, 75% of properties sold for a price per square foot of less than $284, compared to just 67% in 2021. This represents a staggering 75% increase in value.

## Non-Linear Relationship Between Living Space and Sold Price üè†
The data suggests that the relationship between living space in square feet and the sold price of a property is non-linear. The sold price becomes less sensitive to the size of a property beyond 3,000 square feet, while homes with sizes less than 3,000 square feet tend to fit well around the regression line, indicating that the sold price is more sensitive to the size of the property in this range.

## Using XG Boost to Train Model ü§ñ
We train a XG boost algorithm on our cleaned dataset using a max depth of 6 trees with regularization. We use the "Mean Squared Error" as our loss function and MAE as the evaluation metric, we ran 16 boosting iterations. We have tried adjusting the parameters to find better methods to reduce the error on the evaluation set (Test set), but couldn't get better performance. We then conducted error analysis to pinpoint the features driving the large errors. We find that none of the features were causing the larger errors but perhaps the errors are due to features not incorporated in our model. We achieve a MAE on the test set of $69K. 

## Using Neural Networks to Train Model ü§ñ
We trained a NN using 9 layers, reguarilzed, using the MSE as the loss function. NN performed worse than the XG Boost.
